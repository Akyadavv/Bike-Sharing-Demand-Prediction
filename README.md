# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The project is about predicting demand of rentals bike across cities.Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort.It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

The data set consisted of rental bike demands in the past based on various conditions like weather and time of the day. To make the demand prediction I used Regression ML models like linear regression, Lasso regresion and ridge regresion. Based on the prediction made by these models I evaluated which one was giving best predictions.

I utilized various machine learning models, including linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, decision tree, and random forest regression. The objective was to predict the demand for rental bikes based on various features.

After evaluating the performance of these models, we found that linear regression achieved the highest R-squared value of 0.83 on the test data. This indicates that approximately 83% of the variability in the demand for rental bikes can be explained by the linear regression model.

The high R-squared value suggests that the linear regression model is able to capture and model the relationships between the input features and the target variable effectively. It implies that the linear relationship assumptions between the predictors and the target variable hold reasonably well in this context.

However, it's important to note that other models were also employed in this project. Each model might have its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of the best model depends on various factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, and specific project requirements.

In conclusion, the linear regression model demonstrated the highest predictive performance in terms of R-squared, indicating a good fit to the bike sharing demand prediction task. This project provides valuable insights and predictive capabilities for estimating bike rental demand, which can be beneficial for bike sharing companies, urban planners, and policymakers in optimizing bike sharing services and resource allocation.
